 * policy.cjs - Turn blast-radius signals into a firewall verdict.
 *
 * The ladder is allow -> warn -> narrow -> block. Each rung is chosen from the
 * signals alone, so the same call always produces the same verdict.
 *
 * On narrowing: a rewrite is only offered when the narrowed call returns the
 * same results as the original. None of the operations this firewall inspects
 * has such a rewrite — bounding a read, a search, or a log dump necessarily
 * drops results the caller asked for — so `SAFE_REWRITES` is empty and every
 * risky call takes the explain/warn/block path instead. The table is the seam
 * where a provably equivalent rewrite would be added; it is deliberately not a
 * place for "probably fine" narrowing, because silently returning fewer results
 * than the agent asked for is a correctness bug, not a context saving.
