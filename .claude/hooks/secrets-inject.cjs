/**
 * secrets-inject.cjs - Replace ${secret:NAME} with a stored value, in memory.
 *
 * A model can write ${secret:STRIPE_KEY} into a tool call without ever seeing
 * the credential. This PreToolUse hook is what makes that work: it reads the
 * payload, asks the `ak` binary for each referenced value, substitutes in
 * memory, and hands the rewritten input back for the tool to run.
 *
 * What that buys, exactly: the model composed the call from the reference, so
 * the value is absent from the turn the model wrote, and this hook adds no
 * copy of its own — it writes nothing to disk, to a log, or to any channel
 * that reaches the model. It does not follow that the value stops here. The
 * rewritten input is what the harness runs, so the value reaches the tool's
 * process and its arguments, and from there whatever the harness does with an
 * executed call: its transcript, its display, and the `tool_input` it hands to
 * every PostToolUse hook. That is the harness's behavior, not this hook's, and
 * it differs per runtime and per version; treat a released value as present on
 * the host, and rotate it rather than assuming it was never written down.
 *
 * Three rules keep that narrow:
 *
 * - Only the fields in SUBSTITUTABLE_FIELDS are scanned. A blanket walk of the
 *   payload would substitute into file contents and prompts, which is how a
 *   credential ends up committed to a repository.
 * - The caller is never asked who it is. `ak secrets resolve` identifies the
 *   agent by walking the parent-process chain and hashing its binary, so this
 *   hook cannot assert a fingerprint, and a grant is what decides.
 * - Every failure blocks the tool call. Passing the literal reference through
 *   would send ${secret:NAME} to a remote API as if it were a credential, and
 *   the resulting failure would say nothing about why.
